- 👋 Hi,
- I’m Jaroslav Merta and I am software engineer.

# QA engineer

- These days I work as a tester of mobile application and I lead a project of mobile automated tests using Appium in environment composed from Java, Maven, Selenide, Selenium, TestNG, GitLab, Docker, Jenkins and much much more! :)
- Unfortunately, regarding test automation you can not find nothing shared publicly

# Developer

- I am also passionate programmer and creator.
  
## Web

- So far you can see some projects I did in my early career, so you can see I work mostly with Typescript, HTML, CSS, Node.js and I was focus mainly on web application development.
- Website made in Gadsby framwork: https://fri-dom.netlify.app (It was meant to be a blog, but then I gave up that thought and now I am looking for a new purpose)
  - Website is integrated with Contentful and use GrapQL to store and fetch articles in there
  - Why Gadsby? It generates HTML pages, instead of one big javascript file so loading of webpages is super quick and search engine bots likes it much more than content created dynamicaly with javascript :)

## iOS

- These days I develop an application for iOS in Swift and SwiftUI for frontend layer. For backend layer I use node.js to serve API.
